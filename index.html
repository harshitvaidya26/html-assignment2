        <!-- Paragraph 1 about yourself -->
        <p>Hi, My name is Harshit Vaidya and I am studying <b>Interactive Media Design (IMD)</b> at <b>Algonquin College CDI</b> in North York, ON, Canada. My academic voyage is inspired by a sparkling zeal for creativity and innovation, aiming towards engaging me in the <em>elementous</em> universe of graphic designing. I am into designing, drums player, soccer, cooking and Hollywood movies etc. It keeps me grounded and energetic whereas designing for me is my passion and motivation to explore creativity at a whole another level!</p>

        <!-- Paragraph 2 about yourself -->
        <p>The dream that I am working towards is to become a graphic designer with the hopes of having my own company in which I do design and content creation for many different clients. I have done a lot in my academic as well as personal life which, frankly speaking now that I see it and think about it, is something to be proud of. There are certifications like the Certified Dassault Systèmes Associate: Mechanical Design — CSWA Certificate that prove my technical knowledge and proficiency with design software. I am also certified in Emergency First Aid with CPR by the Royal Life Saving Society Canada (certified on 26<sup>th</sup> Feb 2022). The experience of being part of the Delegate Recognition program at the Harvard Model United Nations (<abbr title="HMUN">HMUN</abbr>) in India, over a span of 5 days profoundly enriched my leadership, communication and diplomacy skills. I have a bunch of stories that provide me with a unique angle looking into the creative world and all I want to do is use this long list of taught experiences in my future professional graphic design field, producing content.</p>
